## ⚙ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/build-with-saurav/Plant-Disease-Detection-AI.git
cd Plant-Disease-Detection-AI
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶ Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

This project uses **MobileNetV2** as a pre-trained backbone for feature extraction.

Architecture:

* MobileNetV2 Base Model
* Global Average Pooling Layer
* Dense Layer (128 units, ReLU activation)
* Dropout Layer (0.5)
* Softmax Output Layer

This architecture helps in achieving better generalization with fewer training parameters.

---

## 🌿 Disease Knowledge Base

The system provides:

* Disease description
* Symptoms
* Prevention methods
* Treatment suggestions

This makes the model useful beyond prediction by adding practical agricultural guidance.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Grad-CAM Explainability
* Cloud Deployment
* Mobile App Version
* Multi-language Support
* Real-time Continuous Video Detection
* Treatment Recommendation Engine
